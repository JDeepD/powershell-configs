## Things to install:

1. [Powershell 7](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3)
2. [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)
3. [choco](https://chocolatey.org/install)

PS: I had some problems installing scoop using IWR/IRM. For some reason JioFiber's default DNS server was unable
to resolve `raw.githubusercontent.com`. The fix was to change the DNS server in your computer manually to Google's
DNS server(8.8.8.8). See [this](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/32889#discussioncomment-4320144) and [this](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-your-pcs-dns-settings-windows-10)
